# FanControl.TTTHXXXV2UltraExLT
Themaltake THXXX V2 Ultra EX Liquid Temperature Sensor Plugin for FanControl

## Note
I only tested it with the Thermaltake TH420 V2 Ultra Ex - but should work in theory with all THXXX AOIs from Thermaltake as they should all have the same sensor, and hopefully it's also always on the same interface.
Also note that C# is not my usual stupidity work, so please don't blame me for how messy it is :)
And use at own Risk, of course!

### Install
Download latest relase from [Releases](https://github.com/Plopsi/FanControl.TTTHXXXV2UltraExLT/releases) and extract the content, including the subdirectory, into the Pugins folder of [FanControl](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases).
Please note that you need both dlls as it depends on [HidLibrary](https://github.com/mikeobrien/HidLibrary) as I'm too dumb to make usb-connection with windows build in libs.

If it is working corretly you should find the Sensor in the list:

and under Settings the Liquid Temperature sensor should appear

Thats it, have fun :)
